SHORT DESCRIPTION
    This module is a PowerShell native implementation of former Microsoft's
    File Checksum Integrity Verifier (FCIV).
LONG DESCRIPTION
    The module replaces and enhances discontinued Microsoft's File Checksum
    Integrity Verifier (FCIV) which is intended to monitor file share
    integrity. PsFCIV is two-way compatible with FCIV database format, thus
    transition from FCIV doesn't require any efforts. PsFCIV includes the
    following features:

    * Include or exclude sub-folders, choose algorithms, and direct output.
    * The utility can hash single files, folders, or recursively, large folder
      structures.
    * The hash algorithms available are MD5, SHA1 and SHA2 algorithm family.
      Multiple hashes can be calculated for every file.
    * Adds custom actions for bad (tampered) files: rename or delete file
    * Enhanced verbose and debug logging
    * PsFCIV includes the following working modes:
      - New -- creates a new XML database for file share
      - Check -- checks file share against database for integrity
      - FCIV -- migrates FCIV database to PsFCIV format
      - Rebuild -- adds new files to database and removes no longer existing
        files from database. This mode doesn't check existing files.
      - Online -- performs one-time hash calculation without creating a
        database file.
BUILT-IN COMMANDS
    PsFCIV exports single command 'Start-PsFCIV'. Type 'Get-Help Start-PsFCIV'
